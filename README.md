# Community_D

* `What this script does?`  
    This script steal posts from different communities and posts into yours.

* `Should I be afraid of "Nemezida"?`  
    I don't know really how works "Nemezida".
    But I can say, that we change the photo (adding watermark)
    and I haven't got any strikes yet.

* `How can I specify communities from which I'll steal the posts?`  
    You can specify them in "StaticData.py" in "groups".

* `I don't want to post all posts from other communities.`  
    We know that.
    We create a system, which will offer the post before posting into your group.
    Don't forget to specify your VK ID in "StaticData.py" in "admins".

* `Which watermark will be adding to post's image?`  
    File with watermark have to be in "png" format and called "waterx.png'.
    This file have to place in "source folder".
    
* `Why this readme in english but script using russian?`  
    IDK XD;




#### DO NOT FORGET:
    • Specify groups in "StaticData.py" in "groups".
    • Specify admins in "StaticData.py" in "admins".
    • Create "Data.ini" in "source" folder.
    • Specify VK user access token in "Data.ini" # Look lower for example.
    • Specify VK community access token in "Data.ini" # Look lower for example.
    • Do the "pip3 install -r (path_to_script)/requirements.txt"

  
##### Data.ini EXAMPLE  

    [Data]  
    token = Your VK user api token  
    token_c = Your VK community api token


That's all what I have to say.  
Hope that this script will help you with your communities.
